# Simple Chat UI Options

Since Exyte Chat might be overkill, here are simpler approaches:

## Option 1: Keep It Simple
Use our current simple implementation but with better styling from Apple's HIG (Human Interface Guidelines).

## Option 2: Use ChatUI by x-0o0
Simpler than Exyte Chat, easier to integrate:
- GitHub: https://github.com/x-0o0/ChatUI
- Lighter weight
- Good for basic chat needs

## Option 3: Use Exyte Chat (Current)
Most feature-rich but might need more setup.

## Recommendation

For a health assistant app, **Option 1 (Simple + Better Styling)** is probably best because:
- No external dependencies
- Full control
- Lightweight
- Easy to customize for health-specific needs

Let me know which approach you prefer!
